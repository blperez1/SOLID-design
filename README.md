# Design Principles
Following Design patterns in Python course(udemy)

##SOLID
###Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should only have one reason to change
* Sepration of concerns - Different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems
###Open-Close Principle
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
###Liskov Substition Principle
* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype
###Interface Segregation Principle
* Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
* YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
###Dependency Inversion Principle(not related dependency injection)
* High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
